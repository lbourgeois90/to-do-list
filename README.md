# To-Do List

The To-Do List app is designed for the client to enter in a task that will be added to the To-Do list. Upon completion of the task, the user will check the checkbox to signify completion. If the user would like to clear the to-do list or would has made a mistake and would like to edit the task, there is a delete button designed for those uses.
